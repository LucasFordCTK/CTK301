                This is a song I created for a loop based assignment. I took an original loop from part one of this two part assignment, and added a new idea every four bars and would keep it going till the end. I wanted to keep that loop feel instead of having it feel like a song. I kept the first four bars of this assignment the same, kinda to just use them as a building block. At bar 5 I recorded and added a simple little tambourine part. This was nothing too important so I brought the levels down on it quite a bit so it would kinda just sit in the background. I then added this little water bottle tap that we recorded in class and added a High pass filter on it, pitch corrected it, and added some reverb to it. Finally I added a little midi Synth melody.

                This is a demo of a song Bug Bite, that my band Wasteland and I composed. It is a New Age Grunge style song that is supposed to be energetic and Fun. The Drums were recorded with two overhead AT2020s. The Guitar was recorded with an AT2020 directed at the dust cap, and a SM57 pointed at the dust cap on a 45 degree angle. Finally Bass was recorded DI into the interface. I am very happy with the final product. Although with this being the demo I think for future recordings the tempo should be a little slower to groove a little better. I would also like to record the drums with a full set of kit mics to get a little punchier drums.

                This was my final project for my CTK 204 class. The song was completely composed in Logic Pro using stock midi sounds from their library. When I first started this project the song was supposed to be this sadish lullaby, but when I got more inspiration it slowly shifted to be something that you would hear in a video game when the sun is setting.
