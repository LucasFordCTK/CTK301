                The overall idea for this foley project was to imitate someone walking into our classroom. During my group's recording time we were able to record footsteps, the button being pushed, and a door closing. We took multiple takes of everything so we had multiple sounds to work with. On my own I was able to go through all the shared audio files from the two classes. I was able to find around five different segments that I thought would work well together. I used some of the background buzz throughout the entire project to add a little bit more depth to it. I also used an EQ to change the timbre of the footsteps.

                For this foley track my goal was to create a sense of sitting around a bonfire on a camping trip. My goal was to try and make it a little more immersive with the use of stereo. I have the owls hooting between ears, a radio focused more towards the right ear, and the fire focused more towards the left. Overall I thought this was a fun challenge to do. It made me think more creatively than I am used to. The biggest challenge I had was starting, but once I started it got easier and easier to keep going.
