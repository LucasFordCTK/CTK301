                <p>My musical journey started when I was in 4th grade when I went to pick out an instrument to play for 5th grade band. I chose percussion because like any young boy I wanted to hit drums. I continued my journey through junior high in concert band and did a year of honor band. I was then invited to go to drumline camp for the highschoolers and incoming freshmen. I later auditioned and made the drumline on quads. I marched all four years in highschool even becoming the quad section leader my last two years. Throughout High school I played in our Wind Ensemble, Jazz bands, and did the pit for fall plays. After highschool I was asked to come back and teach drumline, where we were able to make it to state and win our division. This was the first time in the band's history. I also auditioned for the drumline at ISU and was offered a position on quads. I marched for four years and again was quad section leader for my final two years. This is where I met some of my closest friends and was even able to play in one of their grad recitals, and started a band with a few of them. We started a band called Dayshift and released a single called Hideaway where I played guitar on it. I also started a band with my best friends from highschool called wasteland. We are currently in the process of recording an ep where I am doing all the recording, mixing, and mastering.</p>

                <p>Through my time at ISU I have had many ups and downs. I started out as an Physics Engineering student, then switched to Engineering technology. While I enjoyed both of these majors I just could not see myself giving up music after I graduated. Around this time of not knowing what to do my friend from drumline told me about the audio and music production major they had to offer at ISU. I applied and was accepted and ever since my first day of class I knew I made the right decision. I was able to work at the bone as an audio stage hand, and was given the opportunity to work on the stage setup for The Driver Era.</p>
